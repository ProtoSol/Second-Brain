# Reading Log Entry Helper

Purpose: Consistent, concise insertion of reading or paper digestion notes into any *Research Papers* file reading log.

## Copy/Paste Snippet (Markdown Table Row)
```
| 2025-09-22 | Paper Title (Author, Year) | CategoryTag | Key 1-line insight (result/mechanism) | Keep | Follow-up: (Derive X / Implement Y) |
```

## Field Guidance
- Date: YYYY-MM-DD
- Paper Title: Keep short; omit subtitle unless necessary
- CategoryTag: (Foundations | Optimization | Vision | NLP | Rendering | GPU | Math | Systems | AI-Behavior | Ethics)
- Key Insight: Single clause capturing mechanism or contribution
- Keep: (Yes / Archive Soon / Replace)
- Follow-up: Derivation, experiment, code note, or archive decision

## Example Filled
```
| 2025-09-22 | PCA Tutorial (Smith) | Foundations | PCA = variance-maximizing orthonormal basis via SVD | Keep | Derive loading vector scaling |
```

## Integration Suggestion
When finishing a paper:
1. Add row
2. Add derivation (if any) to [[../Derivations/Derivation Log]] backlog or complete it
3. If 3+ similar resources exist, move oldest to Archive

---
Keep log rows atomic and avoid multi-sentence sprawl.
