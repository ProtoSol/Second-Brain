Purpose: Central navigation + progress snapshot across all learning domains and research corpora.

## Domains Overview
| Domain | Learning Note | Research Papers | Primary Outcomes Focus | Dependency Inputs | Current Phase (Manual) |
|--------|---------------|-----------------|------------------------|-------------------|------------------------|
| C++ | [[../9. To Learn/C++]] | [[../10. Research Papers/C++ Papers]] | Systems efficiency, language mastery | DSA, Math (concept translation) | |
| DSA | [[../9. To Learn/DSA]] | [[../10. Research Papers/DSA Papers]] | Algorithmic problem solving | Math (combinatorics), C++ | |
| Data Science | [[../9. To Learn/Data Science]] | [[../10. Research Papers/Data Science Papers]] | End‑to‑end modeling & deployment | Math, DSA | |
| Game Dev | [[../9. To Learn/Game Dev]] | [[../10. Research Papers/Game Dev Papers]] | Playable prototypes & systems | Graphics, DSA | |
| Graphics Eng | [[../9. To Learn/Graphics Engineering]] | [[../10. Research Papers/Graphics Engineering Papers]] | Rendering & GPU performance | Math, C++ | |
| Math for DS | [[../9. To Learn/Math for DS]] | [[../10. Research Papers/Math for DS Papers]] | Derivations & theoretical grounding | (Base) | |

(Add manual phase marker per week: e.g., Data Science → Phase 3 Probability)

## Cross-Domain Threads
- Optimization: C++ (performance), Math (gradients), Data Science (model training), Graphics (shader performance)
- Probability & Uncertainty: Math foundations → Data Science evaluation → Game AI stochastic behaviors
- Parallelism: C++ concurrency → GPU compute (Graphics) → Data Science large-scale training
- Spatial / Geometry: Math linear algebra → Graphics transforms → Game Dev camera & physics

## Progress Metrics (Manual Update)
| Domain | Checklist Items Done / Total | Active Project | Last Log Update |
|--------|-----------------------------|---------------|-----------------|
| C++ | 0 / N | | |
| DSA | 0 / N | | |
| Data Science | 0 / N | | |
| Game Dev | 0 / N | | |
| Graphics Eng | 0 / N | | |
| Math for DS | 0 / N | | |

(Replace N with actual counts; increment as you tick checklists.)

## Upcoming Priority Queue
1. (Fill) – Highest leverage next derivation or system
2. (Fill)
3. (Fill)

## Derivation Log Index
Central derivations stored in: [[Derivations/Derivation Log]] (to be created)

## Archive Reference
- Resource retirements & rationale: [[../99. Archive/Archive]]

## Weekly Review Template
1. What phase advanced? Any blockers?
2. 2–3 derivations reinforced?
3. One system/template extracted?
4. One resource archived?
5. Next week’s singular emphasis focus?

Keep Hub minimal; it is a navigation + planning surface, not a dumping ground.
