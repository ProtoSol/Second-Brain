# Basic Relationship between Variables -

The general method we relate one variable to other is using the simple formula of [[Linear Regression]].

$$
\displaystyle{\displaylines{Y = f(X) + \epsilon}}
$$
where $Y$ is the output, $f$ being some fixed but unknown function of $X_{1}, ...., X_{n}$ and $\epsilon$ is a random error term, which is *independent* of X and has mean zero.
