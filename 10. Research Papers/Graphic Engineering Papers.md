## GPU and Parallel Computing
- GPipe: Efficient Training of Giant Neural Networks using Pipeline Parallelism: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762 (wait, wrong link, actually https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.06965 for GPipe? Wait, from excerpts.

From excerpts: GPipe is https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.06965

But for graphics, CUDA guide.
