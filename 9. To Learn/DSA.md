# DSA Learning

## Purpose
Build deep algorithmic intuition + implementation fluency for problem solving, interviews, systems performance, and competitive programming. Focus on patterns, invariants, and complexity trade-offs.

## Learning Outcomes
- Can classify problems to data structure / paradigm quickly
- Write optimal asymptotic solution with clean code under time pressure
- Reason about time/space complexity and memory layout effects
- Recognize when to use hashing vs tree vs heap vs union-find
- Confident in recursion to iterative transformations

## Phased Roadmap
### Phase 0 (Grounding) â€“ 2â€“3 days
- Big-O, Omega, Theta formal refresh
- Iteration vs recursion, call stack model
- Basic sorting algorithms (bubble, selection, insertion) - implement from scratch

### Phase 1 (Core Linear + Hash) â€“ 1 week
- Arrays / Sliding Window / Two Pointers
- Hash Maps/Sets (collision, load factor awareness)
### Phase 2 (Hierarchical Structures) â€“ 1 week
- Stacks, Queues, Deques (monotonic patterns)
- Linked Lists (cycle detection, in-place ops)
### Phase 3 (Trees) â€“ 2 weeks
- Binary Trees: traversal patterns, DFS variants
- BST properties, balancing intuition (AVL/Red-Black conceptual)
- Heaps / Priority Queues (top-K, scheduling)
- Tries (prefix queries)
### Phase 4 (Graphs) â€“ 2 weeks
- Representations (adj list vs matrix vs edge list)
- Traversals (BFS layers, DFS lowlink)

### Phase 5 (Algorithms Paradigms) â€“ 2 weeks

- Advanced sorting (merge sort, quicksort, heap sort) & hybrid approaches
- Divide & Conquer (merge sort, quickselect, closest pair)
- Greedy proof sketches (exchange arguments)
- Dynamic Programming (1D, 2D, state compression)
- Backtracking (pruning, ordering)
- Basic string algorithms (pattern matching, longest common subsequence)
### Phase 6 (Advanced / Optimization) â€“ ongoing
- Segment Tree / Fenwick Tree
- Disjoint Set advanced (rollback DSU, offline queries)
- Suffix Array / KMP (string processing)
- Bitmask DP
- Graph advanced (toposort variants, SCC, articulation points)

## Mastery Patterns
- Sliding Window, Two Pointers, Frequency Table
- Recursion -> Memoization -> Tabulation
- Invariant tracking & loop reasoning
- Space-Time trade-offs (precomputation vs on-demand)

## Daily Practice Template (repeatable)
1. 1 Warm-up (easy) reviewing previous pattern
2. 2 Core (medium) new pattern or reinforcement
3. 1 Stretch (hard) weekend or alternate days
4. Post-mortem: categorize + tag pattern

# LLD (Low-Level Design) â€“ Start After DSA C++

Status: Planned (defer until DSA C++ foundations are complete)

## Purpose (LLD)

Translate problem statements into maintainable, testable OOP designs with clear responsibilities, SOLID adherence, and extensible abstractions.

## Outcomes (LLD)

- Apply SOLID principles and common patterns intentionally (not cargo-cult).
- Produce class diagrams and responsibility tables before coding.
- Implement clean, dependency-injected modules with unit tests.
- Reason about trade-offs: inheritance vs composition, state vs strategy, events vs polling.

## Mini-Roadmap (LLD) â€“ 2â€“3 weeks

1) Principles: SOLID, cohesion/coupling, interfaces.
2) Patterns by need: Strategy, State, Observer, Factory, Builder, Adapter.
3) Case studies: Logger, Rate Limiter (OO), Parking Lot, Cache wrapper.
