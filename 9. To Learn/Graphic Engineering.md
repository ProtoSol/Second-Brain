# Graphic Engineering Learning

## Context
Graphic Engineering focuses on the principles and techniques for creating and manipulating visual content through software, including 2D/3D rendering, shaders, GPU programming, and real-time graphics. It's essential for game development, simulations, virtual reality, and computer vision applications.

## Topics to Learn
- Basics of Computer Graphics (coordinate systems, transformations)
- Rendering Pipelines (OpenGL, DirectX, Vulkan)
- Shaders (GLSL, HLSL, vertex/fragment/geometry shaders)
- Lighting and Materials
- Textures and Mapping
- GPU Computing (CUDA, OpenCL)
- Ray Tracing and Advanced Rendering Techniques
- Graphics APIs and Libraries (WebGL, Metal)
- Performance Optimization
